<!-- Why Food Security Matters Section -->
<section class="container my-5">
    <h2 class="text-center">Why Food Security Matters</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Food insecurity is more prevalent than many realize, with studies indicating that up to 30% of college students experience this hardship at some point during their studies (Graham et al., 2021). This situation not only affects students’ physical health—leading to increased rates of malnutrition and illness—but also contributes to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, as students struggle to balance their educational goals with the burden of hunger (PMC, 2023) Food insecurity also impacts academic performance. College should be a time of growth and opportunity—not a struggle to meet basic needs. By providing information and support, we aim to help students succeed academically and personally, without the stress of food insecurity.</p>

<!-- Causes of Food Insecurity Section -->
<section class="container my-5">
    <h2 class="text-center">Causes of Food Insecurity</h2>
    <ul class="text-left">
        <li>Rising Tuition Costs</li>
        <p>Many students find themselves taking on significant debt or working long hours to cover basic needs costs, leaving little for food (GAO Report).</p>
        <li>Inadequate Financial Aid and Insufficient Support</li>
        <p>Financial aid often falls short of covering living expenses, especially for those with high financial need. Financial aid packages rarely account for the true cost of living, including food, rent, transportation, and other essentials (NPSAS Hope Center).</p>
        <li>Ineligibility for Federal Assistance Programs</li>
        <p>Many college students struggle to qualify for government food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)(GAO Report).</p>
        <li>Stigma and Limited Awareness of Available Resources</li>
        <p>Food insecurity is often accompanied by stigma, which can discourage students from seeking help, even when resources are available(Health Affairs).</p>
    </ul>
